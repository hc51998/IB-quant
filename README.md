# InteractiveBrokers Algo System

This Java/MySQL framework implements the Interactive Brokers API for algorithmic trading. Included are all essential components to support a basic trading execution system: live price feed, handling for IB price quote limits, order tracking system, margin tracking system, handling for order submission and execution, option chain information request, and kill switches. A system based on this framework, with additional custom modules and proprietary strategies is currently being used to profitably trade US equities and equity options

Requires either TWS or IB Gateway (desktop applications provided by IB) and IB Java API 9.71 (API library package). The API scripts initiate a live socket connection to the desktop TWS and IB Gateway application, which routes requests
Requires US Securities Snapshot and Futures Value Bundle ($10/month), US Equity and Options Add-On Streaming Bundle ($4.95/month) for live price feed. If solely using the framework for executing orders, then these add on costs are not necessary; it is possible to use another data source for live price feeds such as IEX, which is free
It's recommended to simultaneously run price feed and solely reading processes on an IB Gateway paper trading instance (port 4002 in the example) and trade execution/other writing processes on a TWS instance (port 7496 in the example)

Setup instructions

Set up MySQL database

Set up the following tables:

Price:

IBAlgoSystem.price: symbol (VARCHAR(10)), secType (VARCHAR(10)), currency (VARCHAR(3)), expiry (VARCHAR(8)), strike (DOUBLE), callorput (VARCHAR(1)), multiplier (VARCHAR(10)), bid (DOUBLE), ask (DOUBLE), last (DOUBLE), close (DOUBLE), bugCounter (INT), updateTime (BIGINT)
Option details:

IBAlgoSystem.MasterChainList: entry (INT), active (VARCHAR(1)), symbol (VARCHAR(10)), secType (VARCHAR(10)), exchange (VARCHAR(20)), currency (VARCHAR(3)), expiry (VARCHAR(8)), strike (DOUBLE), callorput (VARCHAR(1)), multiplier (VARCHAR(10)), pennyPilot (VARCHAR(1)), moneyness (VARCHAR(3))
Orders:

IBAlgoSystem.orderTracking: orderID (INT), status (VARCHAR(20)), filled (INT), remaining (INT), avgFillPrice (DOUBLE)
Execution failure retry counter:

IBAlgoSystem.counter: counterID (INT)
Cash, margin and risk balance:

IBAlgoSystem.margin: AccruedCash (DOUBLE), AvailableFunds (DOUBLE), BuyingPower (DOUBLE), Cushion (DOUBLE), EquityWithLoanValue (DOUBLE), ExcessLiquidity (DOUBLE), FullAvailableFunds (DOUBLE), FullExcessLiquidity (DOUBLE), FullInitMarginReq (DOUBLE), FullMaintMarginReq (DOUBLE), GrossPositionValue (DOUBLE), InitMarginReq (DOUBLE), LookAheadAvailableFunds (DOUBLE), LookAheadExcessLiquidity (DOUBLE), LookAheadInitMarginReq (DOUBLE), LookAheadMaintMarginReq (DOUBLE), LookAheadNextChange (DOUBLE), MaintMarginReq (DOUBLE), NetLiquidation (DOUBLE), TotalCashValue (DOUBLE)
Module descriptions

SimplePriceFeed

Read in TickerList.csv - a presaved list of contracts to receive live price feeds from. Here, a contract is defined as either a specific option, or stock

TickerList.csv fields: Active (T/F) | symbol | secType | exchange | currency | expiry | strike | right | multiplier
Output prices to the IBAlgoSystem.price MySQL table
LargePriceFeed

Read in IBAlgoSystem.MasterChainList - a list of options contracts to receive live price feeds from

The number of entries may exceed IB's feed limit (FEED_LIMIT). In that case, this script divides the entries into smaller batches to submit to IB
Output prices to IBAlgoSystem.price MySQL table
FetchOptionsChain

Read in TickerList.csv, a presaved list of contracts to receive live price feeds from. Here, a contract is defined as either a specific option, or stock

TickerList.csv fields: Active (T/F) | symbol | secType | exchange | currency | expiry | strike | right | multiplier Read in PennyPilot.csv, a presaved list of Penny Pilot tickers
Output option chain to IBAlgoSystem.MasterChainList MySQL table
TradeStrategy

Template to implement trade strategies - call price feed, submit order execution requests, manage orders and risk

Output order management to IBAlgoSystem.orderTracking MySQL table
Output margin management to IBAlgoSystem.margin MySQL table
KillSwitch

Kills all active orders

Simple walkthrough description

Receive price feed

Start an IB Gateway instance on port 4002 (or custom defined port number)
Define the contracts to receive stock and/or option price feeds for in TickerList.csv
Execute SimplePriceFeed to start price feeds for contracts in TickerList.csv
If TickerList.csv contains only stock tickers, execute FetchOptionsChain to generate the option chain for those tickers
Execute LargePriceFeed to start price feeds for option chains
Restart SimplePriceFeed or LargePriceFeed if problems occur
Execute trade strategy

Start a TWS instance on port 7496 (or custom defined port number)
Execute TradeStrategy
Trigger KillSwitch

In event of emergency only:

Terminate TradeStrategy
Execute KillSwitch to remove outstanding orders
Note the KillSwith does not impact SimplePriceFeed or LargePriceFeed (price feed)
